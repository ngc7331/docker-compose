# Docker compose
Repo for my docker-compose files

Each application's files are on a separate branch

## Notes
### User-defined network
Applications may use a external network "br" as follows:

```
networks:
  br:
    external: true
    name: br
```

create it manually by `docker network create br` if needed

### Extra compose files
Each branch has a `docker-compose.yml` as base file, but some applications may need extra files to work as you wish. For example, to add hardware-accelerated video decoding to Jellyfin, a series of `docker-compose.ha.<method>.yml` are provided.

To use them, you can use multiple `-f` flags to specify extra files. Please refer to [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/#specifying-multiple-compose-files) for more information.

### Use of mirror
You can use `DOCKER_MIRROR=<url> docker compose up` to pull from a mirror instead of the default docker.io or lscr.io, etc.

Set from `.env` file is also supported.

### Application-specific notes
In some cases, there will be application-specific notes below.
